:pushpin: Problem Statement
```markdown
Over the years, as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle technology has continued to advance,  it has become much easier and cheaper to access UAVs.  
It is certain that UAVs are providing comfort to our lives. However, while UAV accessibility has grown, malicious activities have also been  
increasingly common. Especially, UAVs with payloads can easily be employed to endanger innocent civillians or government dignitaries  
with their airborne contents.  
For example, UAVs with payloads could throw harmful materials or explosives into the public airspace.  
Also, some accidents concerning UAVs with payloads occured frequently. In this situation, it is required to  
correctly dectect UAVs with payloads in order to reduce expected harm to the victims.

1. Conducting data collection utilizing laptop
In the prior study [1], data collection was conducted by utilizinng several Raspberry Pis as microphones.  
However, Uosing Raspberry Pis was not as practical as of a method of a method as we'd like,  
due to the time and effort expended setting up every piece of equipment. However,  
employing laptops or cell phones as recording devices instead is a more cost-effective and easily accessible method. 
that can be applied by anyone.  

2. Currently only 600 audio samples were secured for UAV payload classification. Since the dataset is not enough  
for applying deep learning algorithms in the prior study, data augmentation will also be exercised in order to obtain  
a sufficient amount of data. At least 1000 data samples are required for deep learning algorithms and normally 360 audio samples. 
can be obtained by a single collection trip.
